# StudentManagementServerApplication
Grupp2 - Serverprog - Projekt

## Initially:
- Make sure you have Derby and Wildfly fully configurated.
- Start Derby first and connect to your database.
- Start Wildfly second and login to your Management Console.

## Building and Running:
- We build this project using Ant. 
- Make sure that you have a correctly configurated build.xml file.
- We use Intellij while running the build.xml file. 
- If the build.xml is correct, a war will be deployed to your Wildfly Server.
- JPA requires a persistence.xml file in the project. Make sure that it is correctly configurated.

- We run code using our RestClient app: https://github.com/urmandavid/RestClient
